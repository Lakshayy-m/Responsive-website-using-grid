                    company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</h4>
                <p>"I was an EMT for many yeaers before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition
                    and
                    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                    found it incedribly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. THe next 12 weeks waas the best - and most
                    grueling - time of my life. Sice completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working
                    as a
                    Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

                <h4>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>
                <p>"Before joined the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some strcuture from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire cirriculum and
                    staff
                    did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                    team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                    tutorial
                    could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                    development
                    experience. It certainly helped me and land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
                    offers. 100% recommended!"</p>
